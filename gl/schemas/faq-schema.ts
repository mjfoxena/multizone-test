      "acceptedAnswer": {
        "@type": "Answer",
        "text": "The IDC rates electric vehicle driving range. It uses a dynamic test cycle with each cycle lasting 108s. The cycles are repeated until the vehicle is unable to meet the required acceleration and speed needed to complete the cycle. The test is conducted as per the requirement stated under Annex II of the CMVR notified by the Government of India. Testing is carried out under ideal conditions using a chassis dynamometer, with the aim of making the conditions as close to the real world as possible. Testing is performed at different speeds and includes stops, acceleration, and braking."

      "@type": "Question",
      "name": "What is the discrepancy between the IDC estimate and real-world range?",
      "acceptedAnswer": {
        "@type": "Answer",
        "text": "IDC aims to test vehicles under conditions that are realistic and mimic on-road performance; however, it does not cover all possible variations. The vehicle's actual range depends on many factors, including the environment and personal riding habits. For example, one rider might accelerate faster and brake more suddenly than another who may ride more conservatively. While IDC testing aims to be based on real-world performance, it still uses a specific test cycle that is reproducible and repeatable by any testing facility with any vehicle. Because all manufacturers must use the exact same testing conditions, the main purpose of the IDC is to allow for realistic comparison of range between electric vehicles from different manufacturers."
