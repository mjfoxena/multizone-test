            This Preorder Agreement (these “Terms” or “Agreement”) governs the placing of a preorder(“Preorder” or “preorder”) with Ultraviolette Automotive Private Limited (“Ultraviolette”, “UV”, or “we” or “us”) for F77 (“Vehicle”).  
            </p>
            <p className='mb-2 sm:mb-4'>
            Please read all the terms carefully before submitting your Preorder. By submitting your Preorder, you agree to be legally bound by these terms.
            </p>
            <h1 className='font-medium mb-2 sm:mb-4'>1. No Obligations</h1>
            <p className='mb-2 sm:mb-4'>
            We may decline Preorders to avoid over-subscription or as we deem appropriate 
            at our sole discretion. If your Preorder is declined, you will be notified, 
            and your Preorder payment will be refunded.
            </p>
            <p className='mb-2 sm:mb-4'>
            These terms do not constitute an agreement for the sale of a Vehicle and do not
            lock in pricing, a firm production slot, a firm delivery date, or specific Vehicle configuration. To complete the purchase of a Vehicle, you will need to execute a UV Vehicle Sales Agreement or such other agreement decided by us, which will include additional terms and conditions, including the final price sheet for the vehicle you ultimately select (“Your Selected Vehicle”). The Final Sales Agreement may be made with Ultraviolette or its subsidiaries or affiliates or with such other entities authorized by Ultraviolette. Additional payment for Your Selected Vehicle, including taxes and other governmental fees, will be required at that time.
